<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey, I’m Tyler McFarland, a computer science major at UMSL and part of the Pierre Laclede Honors College. 
I’ve always been interested in tech and problem-solving, which pushed me to dive into programming early on.
I’ve built projects in C++ like interest calculators, games, and tools that analyze files, and I’ve also been exploring Java and Python. 
</p>

<p>This past summer, I took a web development course and got more hands-on with building websites.
I even participated in a hackathon where I came up with our team’s project idea and built the site myself, which was a 
fun way to bring both creativity and code together.Outside of class, I work as a Resident Assistant and also at the campus rec center, 
where I’ve developed strong leadership, communication, and crisis management skills. I take pride in being reliable, 
staying calm under pressure, and creating a welcoming environment for others. I’ve kept a strong GPA while balancing multiple roles and activities, and I’m always looking to grow. Whether 
it’s through coding projects, teamwork, or learning new tech, I’m focused on building the skills I need for a future in software development.</p>
