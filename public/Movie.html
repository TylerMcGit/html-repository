<h1>The Best Movies According To Tyler</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. Everything All At Once</h3>
<p>I thought this was a very interesting watch. The story and themes are very thought provoking and just the whole premise had me intruiged.</p>
<h3>2. Sinners</h3>
<p>The music in this movie is amazing and all the inspiration, actors, and just the fresh feeling it gives is great.</p>
<h3>3. Nope</h3>
<p>I know people did not like this movie but I really enjoyed the premise as well and the acting. The alien in the sky and how the people chose to deal with it is fun to think about.</p>
